            We built a Rust engine to efficiently handle the matching of regular expressions.
            In comparison to the conventional DFA/NFA-based approaches, our engine is based on non-deterministic bit vector automata (NBVA), which is faster and more memory-efficient to handle the matching of regular expressions with counting. In benchmarks concerning realistic workloads, our matcher is faster than RE2, PCRE, and Microsofts's CsA engine by orders of magnitude in more than 90% of cases.

            Regular pattern matching is used in numerous application domains, including text processing, bioinformatics, and network security. Patterns are typically expressed with an extended syntax of regular expressions. This syntax includes the computationally challenging construct of bounded repetition or counting, which describes the repetition of a pattern a fixed number of times. We develop a specialized in-memory hardware architecture that integrates counter and bit vector modules into a state-of-the-art in-memory NFA accelerator. 
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>The design is inspired by the theoretical model of nondeterministic counter automata (NCA). A key feature of our approach is that we statically analyze regular expressions to determine bounds on the amount of memory needed for the occurrences of bounded repetition.</li>
              <li>We provide a regex-to-hardware compiler that allows users to make an appropriate selection of counter or bit vector modules. We evaluate our hardware implementation using a simulator based on circuit parameters collected by SPICE simulation in TSMC 28nm CMOS process. </li>
              <li>We find that the use of counter and bit vector modules outperforms unfolding solutions by orders of magnitude. Experiments concerning realistic workloads show up to 76% energy reduction and 58% area reduction in comparison to CAMA, a recently proposed in-memory NFA accelerator.</li>

            Applications that handle massive streaming time series have scalability requirements and would therefore benefit from a multicore implementation of the streaming language/engine. In this project, we proposes a stream query language called ParQL that provides a solution to achieve parallelism with the preservation of sequential semantics for applications that involve the complex analysis of time-series (e.g., outlier detection).

              Many realistic social networks can be presented by evolving bipartite graphs, in which dynamically added elements are divided into two entities and connected by links through these two entities, such as followees and followers in Twitter networks, authors and scientific topics in scholarly networks, users and items in recommendation networks, and etc. However, when adding weights of edges, i.e., connections between elements, how to mathematically model such evolving social networks, along with quantitative characterizations, remains unexplored.
            <br>
              Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving bipartite model (EBM), which, based on empirically validated power-law distribution within multiple realistic social networks, discloses that the distribution of total weights given or received by each element in networks is determined by the weighting scale and bounded by certain ceilings and floors.

            Scholarly networks contain massive scholarly information that can be mainly categorized into three entities, i.e., paper, author and topic, which exhibit a co-evolution over time. <br>
            Though scholarly networks have attracted much attention over the past years, most works focus on single dimension of the network, e.g. citation, collaboration or topic network; while few of them incorporate different kinds of entities into an entirety to generate a systematic understanding of scholarly networks at scale. We bridge this gap by proposing a multi-entity scholarly model (MSM) with succinct theoretical foundation, which amalgamates entities of paper, author and topic into one single framework to simulate interactions among different entities, and thus presenting the co-evolution within scholarly networks.

            <p>
              I used to be a table tennis athlete. In 2016, I helped my undergraduate university to win her first championship in Shanghai.
              Now, I am an amateur table tennis player with rating around 2100. 
              In 2022, I finished as the top 16 of men's singles in USA college table tennis national championships.

              Playing basketball is also one of my hobbies.
